        <h2>Header 1</h2>
            High Priest's appearance and behavior are references to the Dark Bishop, an enemy from Hexen.
            High Priest's artwork is a reference to Ningauble of the Seven Eyes from Fafhrd & The Gray Mouser.
            High Priest and Cannonbalrog can both die of poison and fire during their invulnerable attacks.

        <h2>Header 2</h2>
        Before the Supply Drop Update, the Old King had the same splash screen quote as the Bullet King.
        This boss is a reference to Old King Doran from Demon's Souls; not only is he an "Old King", he defends a crypt as an optional boss. Doran also drops the Eternal Warrior's Ring - the description reads as follows: "The hero Doran, protector of the royal family of Boleteria, lives on forever as a demigod."
        His name and attack patterns may be a reference to the Bullet King in the beta, as there are images where he is shown to throw a flask that spreads in an X formation much like the Old King.
        The Old King has a Bullet Kin next to him that, like the chancellor in the Bullet King boss fight, will chase you around if shot.
        The design and fight patterns of the Old King, in addition to his location and the theme of the Abbey, seem to suggest he is the previous Lead Lord. The vast difference in difficulty also suggests he was a much more fierce ruler.
        The gargoyle-like statue heads decorated behind the Old King resemble that of the two demon statues seen just before the boss fight against Doctor Wolf's Monster

        <h2>Header 3</h2>
            After defeating the Dragun, its body will disintegrate into a skeleton. Its skull will drop onto the platform where the character stands, and the spine will form a bridge to the area containing the Gun That Can Kill The Past. Shooting the skull until it breaks will drop the Obsidian Shell Casing, used to craft the Bullet That Can Kill The Past.
            The bullets fired by the second phase can not be entirely removed by blanks, as they will only remove bullets in a small radius.
            If the player has Wax Wings, Jetpack, Ring of Ethereal Form, or another item that allows the player to fly and attempts to fly behind the Dragun, he will send down a wall of bullets that forces the player back towards the bottom half of the arena. This will happen regardless of whether the Dragun is actively doing an attack or not.
            If the player has Challenge Mode active, the Dragun will always have Dragun Rage and High Stress active, which makes the Dragun much more difficult.
            If the player has accumulated Curse, the knives thrown by the Dragun can be Jammed.
            The hallway to the Dragun makes the vision zoom away from the player. If the player stops only a few steps from the animation, they can teleport into another room, keeping the vision zoomed out for an advantage.
            The rocket he fires can be hit back with Casey.
            With Bloodied Scarf, the player can retreat off screen by dodge rolling downward at the corridor leading to the arena, which grants immunity to some attacks.
            Trivia
            The High Dragun's Ammonomicon image is a reference to Smaug from The Hobbit.
            The High Dragun hides in a mountain of shell casing (or the game's currency), similar to Smaug hiding in a mountain of treasure.

            Trorc's name could also be a play on the words "troll" and "orc", as he has physical traits common in most representations of both creatures.
            His name could also be a play on the words "trader" and "orc", as he trades goods for credits, and is an orc.
            His name may also be a pun on the word "Torque" as he is sat in the back of a truck.

        <h2>header 5</h2>
            Frifle and the Grey Mauser are a reference to Fafhrd and the Gray Mouser.
            Frifle is a pun on Fafhrd and Rifle.
            Grey Mauser is also a reference to Mauser, a German arms manufacturer.
            The Official comic centres entirely on how both Frifle and Grey Mauser ended up in the dungeon.
            The comic also reveals that their original goal was to kill the past due to an accident.
