            <div class="vinstri">The Byzantine Empire,
             also referred to as the Eastern Roman Empire and Byzantium, 
             was the continuation of the Roman Empire in its eastern provinces during Late Antiquity and the Middle Ages, 
             when its capital city was Constantinople (modern-day Istanbul, 
             which had been founded as Byzantium). 
             It survived the fragmentation and fall of the 
             Western Roman Empire in the 5th century AD and continued 
             to exist for an additional thousand years until it fell to the Ottoman Turks in 1453. 
             During most of its existence, the empire was the most powerful economic, 
             cultural, and military force in Europe. Both "Byzantine Empire" and "Eastern Roman Empire" 
             are historiographical terms created after the end of the realm; 
             its citizens continued to refer to their empire as the Roman Empire 
             (Greek: Βασιλεία τῶν Ῥωμαίων, tr. Basileia tôn Rhōmaiōn; Latin: Imperium Romanum), or Romania (Ῥωμανία), 
             and to themselves as "Romans".</div>
