        <div class="vinstri">The Roman army succeeded in conquering many territories covering the 
            entire Mediterranean region and coastal regions in southwestern Europe and north Africa. 
            These territories were home to many different cultural groups, 
            both urban populations and rural populations. Generally speaking, 
            the eastern Mediterranean provinces were more urbanised than the western, 
            having previously been united under the Macedonian Empire and Hellenised by the influence of Greek culture.

                The West also suffered more heavily from the instability of the 3rd century AD. 
                This distinction between the established Hellenised East and the younger Latinised 
                West persisted and became increasingly important in later centuries, 
                leading to a gradual estrangement of the two worlds.
                
                Decentralization of power
                See also: Byzantium under the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties
                To maintain control and improve administration, various schemes to divide 
                the work of the Roman Emperor by sharing it between individuals were tried between 
                285 and 324, from 337 to 350, from 364 to 392, and again between 395 and 480. 
                Although the administrative subdivisions varied, they generally involved a division of 
                labour between East and West. Each division was a form of power-sharing (or even job-sharing), 
                for the ultimate imperium was not divisible and therefore the empire remained legally one state—although 
                the co-emperors often saw each other as rivals or enemies.
                
                In 293, emperor Diocletian created a new administrative system (the tetrarchy), 
                to guarantee security in all endangered regions of his Empire. 
                He associated himself with a co-emperor (Augustus), and each co-emperor then adopted 
                a young colleague given the title of Caesar, to share in their rule and eventually to succeed the senior partner. 
                The tetrarchy collapsed, however, in 313 and a few years later Constantine I reunited the two administrative 
                divisions of the Empire as sole Augustus.
                
                Recentralisation
                
                After the death of Theodosius I in 395 the empire was divided. 
                The western part collapsed in the 400s while the eastern part ended with the capture of Constantinople 
                1453.
                  The Western Roman Empire
                  The Eastern Roman/Byzantine Empire
                
                Restored section of the Theodosian Walls
                In 330, Constantine moved the seat of the Empire to Constantinople, 
                which he founded as a second Rome on the site of Byzantium, a city strategically 
                located on the trade routes between Europe and Asia and between the Mediterranean and the Black Sea. 
                Constantine introduced important changes into the Empire's military, monetary, civil and religious institutions. 
                As regards his economic policies in particular, he has been accused by certain scholars of "reckless fiscality", 
                but the gold solidus he introduced became a stable currency that transformed the economy and promoted development.
                
                
                Under Constantine, Christianity did not become the exclusive religion of the state, 
                but enjoyed imperial preference, because the emperor supported it with generous privileges. 
                Constantine established the principle that emperors could not settle questions of doctrine on their own, 
                but should summon instead general ecclesiastical councils for that purpose. 
                His convening of both the Synod of Arles and the First Council of Nicaea indicated his interest in the unity 
                of the Church, and showcased his claim to be its head. The rise of Christianity was briefly interrupted on 
                the accession of the emperor Julian in 361, who made a determined effort to restore polytheism throughout 
                the empire and was thus dubbed "Julian the Apostate" by the Church. 
                However this was reversed when Julian was killed in battle in 363.
                
                Theodosius I (379–395) was the last Emperor to rule both the Eastern and Western halves of the Empire.
                 In 391 and 392 he issued a series of edicts essentially banning pagan religion. 
                 Pagan festivals and sacrifices were banned, as was access to all pagan temples and places of worship. 
                 The last Olympic Games are believed to have been held in 393. 
                 In 395, Theodosius I bequeathed the imperial office jointly to his sons: 
                 Arcadius in the East and Honorius in the West, once again dividing Imperial administration. 
                 In the 5th century the Eastern part of the empire was largely spared the difficulties faced by the West—due
                  in part to a more established urban culture and greater financial resources, 
                  which allowed it to placate invaders with tribute and pay foreign mercenaries. 
                  This success allowed Theodosius II to focus on the codification of Roman law and further 
                  fortification of the walls of Constantinople, which left the city impervious to most attacks until 1204. 
                  Large portions of the Theodosian Walls are preserved to the present day.
                
                To fend off the Huns, Theodosius had to pay an enormous annual tribute to Attila. 
                His successor, Marcian, refused to continue to pay the tribute, but Attila had already diverted his 
                attention to the West. After Attila's death in 453, the Hun Empire collapsed, 
                and many of the remaining Huns were often hired as mercenaries by Constantinople.</div>
